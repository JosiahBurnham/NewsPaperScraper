# NewsPaperScraper
This Program scrapes your personally chosen news sites, and gives you their top articles, summary of that article, and the article's picture, all in a convenient Microsoft Word document that can be set up to email to whomever, at a given time.
This only works if you add all the correct information into the excel files which can be fairly tricky depending on the website
